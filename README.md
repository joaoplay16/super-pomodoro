# Super Pomodoro
Super Pomodoro is a productivity app designed to help users effectively manage their time using the Pomodoro technique.
With its unique features including group chat and games for breaks, Super Pomodoro offers a comprehensive and enriching experience.
The app has been developed using Jetpack Compose and follows the MVVM architectural pattern.

## Features

-   **Pomodoro Technique**: The app utilizes the Pomodoro technique, a proven method for enhancing focus and productivity. Users can set work periods of 25 minutes, known as "pomodoros," followed by short break intervals. The app includes a built-in timer that notifies users when it's time to switch between work and break sessions.

-   **Group Chat**: In addition to the core Pomodoro functionality, Super Pomodoro offers a group chat feature. Users can create themed chat rooms, invite colleagues or friends, and share ideas, challenges, and motivation. This feature encourages collaboration and the exchange of experiences, fostering a virtual environment of support and personal growth.

-   **Games for Breaks**: Recognizing the importance of rest during breaks between pomodoros, Super Pomodoro includes a collection of interactive and engaging games. Users can enjoy a variety of captivating games, ranging from challenging puzzles to stimulating memory games. These games are designed to help users relax and recharge their minds, providing productive leisure moments during breaks.

-   **Firebase Integration**: The app integrates with Firebase services, including Firebase Authentication, Firebase Firestore, and Firebase Storage. Firebase Authentication enables secure user registration and login, safeguarding personal information.
